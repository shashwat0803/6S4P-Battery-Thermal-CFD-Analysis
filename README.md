Thermal Performance Evaluation of a 6S4P Li-ion Battery Module (CFD Study)
Project Objective

To evaluate the thermal performance of a 6S4P cylindrical Li-ion battery module under 1C discharge using SolidWorks Flow Simulation and assess the impact of convective cooling conditions.


System Configuration

Battery configuration: 6S4P (24 cylindrical cells)

Cell type: Cylindrical Li-ion

Total heat generation: 6.48 W (0.27 W per cell)

Ambient temperature: 25°C

Cooling mechanism: Air convection

Solver: SolidWorks Flow Simulation (CFD)


Simulation Setup
Governing Physics:

Conjugate heat transfer

Solid conduction

Fluid convection

Steady-state analysis


Boundary Conditions:

Heat source applied volumetrically to each cell

Ambient temperature: 25°C

Heat transfer coefficient cases:

Natural convection (h = 10 W/m²K)

Forced air (h = 50 W/m²K)


Assumptions:

Uniform heat generation inside cells

No radiation effects

Constant material properties

Incompressible airflow


Key Results
| Case   | Cooling Type       | h (W/m²K) | Tmax (°C) |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Case 1 | Natural Convection | 10        | 75°C      |
| Case 2 | Forced Air         | 50        | 39°C      |


Observations:

Passive cooling insufficient for sustained 1C discharge.

Increasing convective heat transfer reduced peak temperature by ~48%.

Conductive aluminum plate improved temperature uniformity.


Engineering Insights

Convective boundary conditions strongly influence battery temperature.

Conductive plate alone is insufficient under natural convection.

Moderate airflow ensures safe operating conditions.

Thermal management must combine conduction + active convection.


Validation Approach

Heat generation calculated using:

Q = I²R

Compared temperature range with typical Li-ion operating limits (45–60°C).

Verified energy balance consistency.


Future Improvements

2C discharge scenario

Liquid cooling channel design

Parametric plate thickness optimization

CFD airflow duct optimization
